### Fingerprint Recognition Modules: Complete Solutions for Identity Verification

DejaOS now provides comprehensive fingerprint recognition capabilities through two powerful modules: **dxFingerZaz** and **dxFingerMz**. Both modules enable developers to implement secure, reliable fingerprint-based authentication systems with ease.

#### Overview

Fingerprint recognition is one of the most widely used biometric authentication methods, offering a perfect balance between security and convenience. Both modules communicate with fingerprint recognition hardware via UART serial port.

#### Two Powerful Modules

**dxFingerZaz Module**
The **dxFingerZaz** module uses **ID-based identification** (range 1-5000) and provides 3 RAM buffers for flexible fingerprint processing. Key features include:

- **Independent Finger Detection**: Dedicated `fingerDetect()` function.
- **Flexible Feature Merging**: Supports merging 2-3 captures for improved accuracy.
- **Universal Image Capture**: Single `getImage()` function for all use cases.
- **Complete Management**: Full template storage, loading, upload, and download capabilities.

**dxFingerMz Module**
The **dxFingerMz** module uses **Page Index-based identification** (range 0-65535) and provides 2 character buffers. It offers advanced automation features:

- **Auto Registration**: One-click registration process.
- **Auto Identification**: Automatically completes capture, extraction, and library search.
- **Dual Capture Modes**: Separate functions for verification (`getImage()`) and enrollment (`getEnrollImage()`).
- **Large Capacity**: Supports up to 65,535 templates.

#### Use Cases

Ideal for Access Control Systems, Time & Attendance, Device Authentication, and personal identification.

### UI Animation Examples: Enhancing User Experience with LVGL Animations

LVGL supports a wide variety of animation effects, providing developers with powerful tools to create smooth and engaging user interfaces.

#### Three Animation Examples

We've prepared three distinct animation examples showcasing different techniques:

**Example 1: LVGL-Based Animation**
This example demonstrates how to create smooth animations using LVGL's native animation functions.

### DejaOS 2.1.0 Released: Enhanced System Management, Faster Code Sync, and Improved Face Recognition

We are excited to announce the release of DejaOS 2.1.0! This version brings significant improvements in system management, development efficiency, and facial recognition performance.

#### 1. Upgraded System Management App

The System Management App has been completely redesigned, transitioning from a PC tool-based management mode to a modern device-side interface management mode.

**New Version: Device-Side Management (With Interface)**

- **Easy Access**: Long-press anywhere on the screen during the 2-second gray startup background to enter.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Four core modules including Network Config, Sys Info, System Config, and Install App.
- **Remote Web Management**: Built-in Web server allows remote management via browser.
- **Faster Operations**: Eliminates serial cable bottlenecks.

For more details, please refer to the [System Management App documentation](/docs/basics/managerapp).

#### 2. Dramatically Improved Code Sync Speed

Code sync speed has improved by approximately **10x** compared to version 2.0.0, making the development workflow much more efficient.

#### 3. Updated Facial Recognition Base Library

The facial recognition foundation has been updated with enhanced stability and speed, optimized algorithms, and better resource management.

## 11-13

### Major Upgrade: The All-New Facial Recognition Component, dxFacial, is Officially Released!

We are excited to announce a landmark major upgrade to DejaOS's facial recognition capabilities! The old `dxFace` component has been refactored into the new `dxFacial`.

#### Core Improvements in `dxFacial`

1. **Extremely Simplified, Clear, and Easy to Use**
   API redesigned to hide non-essential parameters. You can quickly implement a complete application with just a few simple functions.

2. **A Leap in Performance and Stability**
   Significant improvements in recognition speed, resource consumption, and long-term operational stability.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation Support**
   New series of [Facial Recognition Development Overview](https://dejaos.com/docs/face/overview) documents.

#### Device Adaptation Progress

Successfully adapted to all mainstream devices: **VF202, VF203, VF114, VF105**.

## 09-10

### DejaOS VSCode Extension Now Supports macOS

The latest version of the DejaOS extension now natively supports macOS via the **HID (Human Interface Device) protocol**.

#### Usage Notes

Our devices use the standard HID protocol, which means you **don't need to install any extra drivers**. The system will automatically recognize it.

![Windows HID Device](/img/blog/devicemanage.png)

On some macOS systems, you might see a prompt: "HID Device Not Ready. Please retry after about 30 seconds." This is normal as the HID service initializes.

- `dxHttpClient` &rarr; `dxHttp`
- `dxHttpServer` &rarr; `dxWebserver`
- `dxMqttClient` &rarr; `dxMqtt`
- `dxNetwork` &rarr; `dxNet`

### Boot Screen Background

#### Changing the Application Background

The application boot background is simply an image assigned to a `dxui.Image` control.

```js
let screen_img = dxui.Image.build("screen_img", screen_main);
mainView.screen_img = screen_img;
screen_img.source("/app/code/resource/image/bk_90.png");
```

#### Replacing the Device Boot Background

The device boot background is a system-level resource managed by the firmware. Currently, we support customizing it during firmware image creation.
