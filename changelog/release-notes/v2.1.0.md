# DejaOS 2.1.0 (Latest Recommended)

**DejaOS 2.1.0 is the currently recommended version.** Compared to 2.0.0, it focuses on improving system management convenience and the development experience. We strongly recommend all 2.0.0 users upgrade to this version for the best experience.

### 1. System Management: Visual Upgrade

This version introduces the all-new [**System Manager App**](https://dejaos.com/zh/docs/basics/managerapp/), completely replacing the Safe Mode in 2.0.0.

- **2.0.0 (Old Way)**: Relied on **Safe Mode**, requiring RS485 serial connection, which was cumbersome and slow.
- **2.1.0 (New Way)**: Supports **Visual On-Screen Operation** and **Web Remote Management**. No special cables needed; you can complete app installation, mode switching, and other operations directly on the device screen or via a computer browser.

### 2. Development Experience: Speed Optimization

- **Optimized USB Data Transfer Protocol**: Solved the slow code synchronization issue in 2.0.0 development mode, significantly improving debugging efficiency.
