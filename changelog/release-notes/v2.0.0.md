# DejaOS 2.0.0

DejaOS 2.0.0 was a milestone version that established the standard for modern DejaOS application architecture. Compared to 1.0.0, it made significant improvements in standardization and low-level management.

> **Upgrade Advice**: Although version 2.0.0 is fully functional, due to the relatively outdated development experience and management methods, it is recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.0 as soon as possible.

### 1. Maintenance Mechanism: Added Safe Mode

- **1.0.0**: Lacked a low-level emergency management mechanism.
- **2.0.0**: Added **Safe Mode**, allowing system maintenance and app installation via serial tools.

### 2. App Standards: Comprehensive Upgrade

- **Package Format**: Upgraded from `.zip` to `.dpk` (DejaOS Package).
  - _Note: Supports one-click packaging via VSCode plugin (default full package), replacing the manual compression of 1.0.0._
- **Directory Structure**: Introduced a more standardized hierarchy, adding the `/app/code` prefix to source paths (e.g., `/app/code/src/main.js`).
- **OTA Path**: Simplified the upgrade package path to `/upgrades.zip` (1.0.0 was `/app/data/upgrades/APP_1_0.zip`).
