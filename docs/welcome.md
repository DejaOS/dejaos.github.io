# What is DejaOS

## 🌐 Overview

**DejaOS** is a JavaScript runtime environment purpose-built for embedded devices, enabling low-cost, resource-constrained smart hardware to run JavaScript code efficiently. By adopting JavaScript as the primary development language, DejaOS dramatically lowers the barrier and cost for embedded development, making the process simpler and more productive.

DejaOS has been successfully deployed in various IoT scenarios, demonstrating excellent performance and development efficiency.

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### 📥 Environment Setup

- Install [Node.js (v20+)](https://nodejs.org)
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Install the [DejaOS IDE extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dxide.dxide)

### 🔧 Device Preparation

1. Acquire a development device
2. Connect the device to your computer (VSCode) via USB

### 🧪 Quick Start

- Use JavaScript in VSCode to [build your first application](./basics/quick-start.md)
- Instantly sync code to your device and view real-time logs

### 📦 Build & Deploy

1. Acquire production devices
2. Use VSCode to package your project as a `.dpk` installer
3. Deploy via OTA or use the [DPK installer tool](https://github.com/DejaOS/DejaOS/tree/main/tools) for serial installation
