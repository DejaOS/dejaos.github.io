DejaOS is a JavaScript runtime environment designed for embedded devices, enabling low-cost, low-spec smart devices to run JavaScript code. It uses JavaScript as the development language, reducing costs and simplifying development.

### üöÄ Core Features

DejaOS provides a comprehensive set of JavaScript modules for embedded development:

- **Hardware Interface Module** - GPIO, PWM, UART, RS-485, RS-232, USB, Wiegand, Watchdog, Capturer, ALSA, NFC, QRCode, BLE, Face Recognition, etc.
- **Networking and Communication Protocol Module** - Net, TCP, TCP Server, MQTT, UDP, HTTP, Web Server, OSDP, etc.
- **Graphics Module** - Supports drawing GUI screens using JavaScript, compatible with all LVGL native capabilities.
- **Utility Module** - Threads, encryption/decryption, logging, EventBus, NTP, SQLite, etc.
- **Third-Party Module** - Supports using pure JavaScript third-party modules with import (ESM).
- **Native C Library Support** - Allows development through embedded native C libraries wrapped in JavaScript.

### üõ† Technical Foundation

DejaOS is built on the foundations of Mip/ARMLinux, QuickJS, and LVGL:

- **Mip/ARMLinux** - Embedded Linux with system processes, threads, and resource scheduling capabilities.
- **QuickJS** - A compact and fast JavaScript engine that supports the ES2020 standard.
- **LVGL** - The most popular free open-source embedded graphics library, allowing easy creation of beautiful UIs using JavaScript.

### üì± Development Process

The development process for DejaOS apps is straightforward:

1. **Prepare Development Environment** - Install Node.js (20+), VSCode, and DXIDE (VSCode plugin)
2. **Connect Device** - Connect your development device to VSCode using USB
3. **Write Code** - Write JavaScript applications in VSCode with real-time sync
4. **Build & Deploy** - Build DPK installation packages and deploy to production devices

### üéØ Why Choose DejaOS?
