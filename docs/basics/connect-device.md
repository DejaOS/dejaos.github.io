## 🔌 Device Connection Types

DejaOS devices come in two connection types:

### Type 1: Direct USB-A Cable

Some devices come with a built-in USB-A male connector cable. Simply plug the USB-A connector directly into your computer's USB port.

### Type 2: USB Type-C Receptacle

Some devices feature a **USB Type-C receptacle**. For these devices, you need to use a USB Type-C to USB-A data cable to connect to your computer.

## ✅ Verify Device Recognition

DejaOS devices are **HID (Human Interface Device) devices**. When connected, the operating system typically does not show a popup notification. You need to manually verify that the device has been recognized. This is not a required step, but it can help you confirm that the device is properly connected.

### Windows

1. Open **Device Manager** (press `Win + X` and select "Device Manager")
2. Expand the **"Human Interface Devices"**  category
3. Look for **"HID-compliant device"** in the list

> If you see "HID-compliant device" listed and Id is `0x0525`, your device has been successfully recognized.

### macOS

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   system_profiler SPUSBDataType
   ```
3. Look for a device entry with:
   - **Product ID:** `0xa4ac`
   - **Vendor ID:** `0x0525`

> If you find a device matching these IDs, your DejaOS device has been successfully recognized.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If your device is not recognized:

1. **Check the USB cable connection** - Ensure the cable is firmly connected at both ends
2. **Try a different USB port** - Some USB ports may not provide sufficient power
3. **Try a different cable** - If using a Type-C device, ensure the cable supports data transfer (not just charging)
4. **Check device power** - Ensure the device is powered on
5. **Restart your computer** - Sometimes a system restart helps with device recognition
