## 🌐 Network Requirements

During development, DejaOS IDE may need to download official JavaScript modules:

- **Online Development**: Access the DejaOS module repository to fetch the latest modules and dependencies.
- **Offline Development**: Previously downloaded modules are cached locally, allowing continued development without an internet connection.

> We recommend staying online to ensure you always have access to the latest modules.
