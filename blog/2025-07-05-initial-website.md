Familiar Feeling. New Frontier.
A JavaScript-powered OS redefining embedded development.

While the DejaOS GitHub repository was released around this time last year, we've been missing a dedicated official website. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of the DejaOS official website built on the Docusaurus framework, marking a crucial milestone in DejaOS's community development and ecosystem building.

## Overview

DejaOS development began two years ago, initially exploring embedded scripting possibilities by combining Lua with C. Our technical direction shifted when we discovered QuickJS, the JavaScript engine developed by Fabrice Bellard. We redesigned the entire system architecture using QuickJS as the core, integrated with the LVGL graphics engine.

On our DW200 devices, DejaOS rapidly progressed from trial to production, successfully deployed across multiple smart hardware applications including card readers, access control systems, and facial recognition devices. We've gradually replaced early C-based firmware with JavaScript applications.

Last year around this time, we officially released the [DejaOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/DejaOS/DejaOS). To date, over 100 individual and enterprise developers have participated in collaboration, receiving widespread positive feedback.

To better serve developers and promote ecosystem development, we've now launched our official website: https://dejaos.com  
The website will focus on providing technical documentation, development tutorials, and real-world case studies, complementing the open-source code on GitHub.

### Website Content Structure

- **Guide**: Introduces DejaOS core concepts, development environment setup, and common troubleshooting;
