We are excited to announce a landmark major upgrade to DejaOS's facial recognition capabilities! The old `dxFace` component has been completely refactored and officially upgraded to the new `dxFacial` component. This upgrade aims to provide developers with a more powerful, stable, and user-friendly development experience.

## Why the Refactor?

As DejaOS is being used on more and more facial recognition devices, we became deeply aware that the old `dxFace` component had some shortcomings in terms of usability and stability. To thoroughly address these issues and lay a solid foundation for future feature expansion, we decided to undertake a complete refactor.

## Core Improvements in `dxFacial`

The new `dxFacial` component brings the following exciting changes:

### 1. Extremely Simplified, Clear, and Easy to Use

We have redesigned the API, **hiding a large number of non-essential underlying parameters**. Now, you no longer need to worry about complex camera configurations or algorithm thresholds. With just a few simple functions, you can quickly implement a complete facial recognition application. The entire usage method has become unprecedentedly simple and clear.

### 2. A Leap in Performance and Stability

Through deep optimization of the underlying algorithms and data flow, `dxFacial` has achieved significant improvements in **recognition speed, resource consumption, and long-term operational stability**. Whether in high-concurrency access control scenarios or on attendance devices that require continuous operation, `dxFacial` performs exceptionally well.

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation Support

To help you get started quickly, we have written a new series of [**Facial Recognition Development Overview**](https://dejaos.com/docs/face/overview) documents. The documentation starts with basic concepts, progressively introduces the three core processes of face detection, registration, and recognition, and provides complete API descriptions and code examples.

## Device Adaptation Progress

We are progressively adapting the new `dxFacial` component to all our mainstream facial recognition devices. The current adaptation work is mostly complete, following this order:

1.  **VF202**
2.  **VF203**
3.  **VF114**
4.  **VF105**

We encourage all developers who are using or planning to use DejaOS for facial recognition development to migrate to the new `dxFacial` component as soon as possible and experience the efficiency and convenience it brings.

We believe this upgrade will significantly lower the barrier to entry for developing facial recognition applications and enhance the stability and user experience of the final product. We look forward to seeing the amazing applications you create with `dxFacial`!
